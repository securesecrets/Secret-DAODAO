# DAO Hooks
This package provides an interface for managing and dispatching proposal, 
staking, and voting related hooks. 

### NFT Stake Hooks
Staking hooks are fired when NFTs are staked or unstaked in a DAO.

### Proposal Hooks
There are two types of proposal hooks:
- **New Proposal Hook:** fired when a new proposal is created.
- **Proposal Staus Changed Hook:** fired when a proposal's status changes. 

Our wiki contains more info on [Proposal Hooks](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/wiki/Proposal-Hooks-Interactions).

### Stake Hooks
Staking hooks are fired when tokens are staked or unstaked in a DAO.

### Vote Hooks
Vote hooks are fired when new votes are cast.

You can read more about vote hooks in our [wiki](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/wiki/Proposal-Hooks-Interactions).
